This project consists of a Study of characteristics of real network nodes using
metrics used in Lab1. 
Community Detection is performed as a partition problem of a graph with
the algorithms:
- Spectral Clustering
- Newman-Girvan
- Modularity Maximization

The evaluation of the created partitions is made with the metrics:
- modularity
- performance

The datasets used: 
- American College Football, http://konect.cc/networks/dimacs10-football/
- Game of Thrones S5, https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/the-series/season-5/
- Email-Eu-core network, https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Eu-core.html
