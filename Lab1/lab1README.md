This project develops the construction and visualization of complex types of networks (REG, RGER, RGG, SF, SW). 
We compute and deal with network metrics such as clustering coefficient, minimum path length, eccentricity, diameter, radius, periphery, etc.. 
Also node centrality metrics such as degree, closeness, betweenness and Katz are analyzed along with the the connectivity and robustness of the networks. 
PageRank algorithm is applied in a real world network.
