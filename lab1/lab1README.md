In this project, different types of networks are constructed and visualized (REG (Regular), RGER (Random graph), RGG (Random geometric graph), SF (Scale-free), SW (Small-world)).
Study of connectivity and robustness of networks.
Evolutionary network conversion study.
Study of real networks.
Network metrics are studied and calculated:
  - clustering coefficient
  - minimum path length
  - eccentricity
  - diameter, radius, periphery
 
Node centrality metrics:
  - degree
  - closeness
  - betweenness
  - Katz centrality

PageRank is applied to a real network.
